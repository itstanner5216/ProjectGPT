# AetherCore.EventMesh Skill

## Overview

The **AetherCore.EventMesh** skill creates a dynamic automation bridge that links Event Hooks and the Skill Messaging Bus into a silent, self-updating event graph. This enables all active skills to trigger each other automatically without manual intervention or user-visible operations.

## What's New in v1.1

Version 1.1 introduces dependency-aware routing capabilities that enable sophisticated multi-stage automation workflows. The new system includes queued event handling through the `_pending_events` mechanism, which allows events to wait for prerequisite stages to complete before executing. Skills can now declare stage dependencies using the `after` parameter in event payloads, and the `mark_stage_complete()` function enables precise control over execution order. This ensures that complex automation pipelines execute in the correct sequence even when dealing with asynchronous operations or interdependent skill chains.

## Purpose

This skill serves as the **invisible orchestration layer** for Project GPT's skill ecosystem:

- **Automatic Routing**: Events from one skill automatically flow to dependent skills
- **Dynamic Updates**: Graph rebuilds when skills load or unload
- **Silent Operation**: All automation happens in the background
- **Dependency Management**: Maintains correct execution order based on skill dependencies
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses cached routing tables for O(1) event lookup

## Architecture

### Graph Structure

The automation graph uses a directed graph model:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ AetherCore.OptiGraph│
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ (triggers)
           ▼
    ┌──────────────────┐
    │AetherCore.DeepForge│
    └──────┬─────────────┘
           │ (sends results)
           ▼
      ┌───────────────────────┐
      │AetherCore.MarketSweep │
      └───────────────────────┘
```

### Components

**Nodes**: Each loaded skill
- Properties: name, dependencies, subscribers, message handlers, active status

**Edges**: Message routes between skills
- Properties: source, target, event_type, priority

**Routing Table**: Pre-computed paths for efficient event distribution
- Format: `{(source, event_type): [target1, target2, ...]}`

## Integration Hooks

The Automation Graph integrates with Project GPT's lifecycle events:

| Hook | Purpose | When Called |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `on_registry_init` | Build initial graph | System startup |
| `on_skill_load` | Add new skill node | Skill dynamically loaded |
| `on_skill_exit` | Remove skill node | Skill unloaded |
| `on_message` | Route events | Any skill emits event |

## Installation

### Automatic Installation

1. Download `AetherCore.EventMesh.zip`
2. Place in your project's `project_files` directory
3. The skill auto-registers on next session startup

### Manual Verification

After placement, verify the skill is loaded:

```bash
# Check project_files directory
ls project_files/AetherCore.EventMesh.zip

# Skill should appear in registry automatically
# No activation command needed
```

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Research Pipeline

When you have these skills loaded:
- `AetherCore.OptiGraph`
- `AetherCore.DeepForge`
- `AetherCore.MarketSweep`

AetherCore.EventMesh automatically creates this flow:

```
User Request
    ↓
AetherCore.OptiGraph (analyzes requirements)
    ↓ (event: research_needed)
AetherCore.DeepForge (conducts research)
    ↓ (event: results_ready)
AetherCore.MarketSweep (finds relevant deals)
    ↓
Final Output to User
```

**No manual triggering required** - the graph routes events automatically.

### Example 2: Content Generation Pipeline

```
content-planner → style-analyzer → markdown-formatter → quality-checker
```

When `content-planner` emits a `draft_complete` event:
1. AetherCore.EventMesh checks routing table
2. Identifies `style-analyzer` as subscriber
3. Routes event with payload via Messaging Bus
4. Process continues through pipeline automatically

### Example 3: Monitoring Pipeline

```
system-monitor ──┬──→ log-aggregator
                 │
                 ├──→ alert-manager
                 │
                 └──→ metrics-collector
```

When `system-monitor` broadcasts an `alert` event:
- All three subscribers receive the event simultaneously
- Each processes independently
- No race conditions or conflicts

## Silent Operation

AetherCore.EventMesh operates **completely silently**:

✓ No console output  
✓ No status messages  
✓ No confirmation dialogs  
✓ No user-visible indicators  
✓ All logging is internal only  

You'll know it's working because:
- Skills trigger each other automatically
- Events flow without manual routing
- Complex pipelines execute seamlessly

## Technical Details

### Performance

- **Event Routing**: O(1) lookup via cached routing table
- **Graph Updates**: O(n) where n = number of affected edges
- **Memory**: Minimal - only stores graph structure and routing table
- **Overhead**: Negligible - routing adds <1ms per event

### Thread Safety

The Automation Graph is designed for concurrent operation:
- Event routing is atomic
- Graph updates are synchronized
- No race conditions in multi-skill scenarios

### Error Handling

Silent failures for robustness:
- Unknown source skill → log internally, no error
- Inactive target → skip silently
- Circular dependencies → detected and prevented
- Malformed events → logged, not propagated

## Configuration

The skill uses these default settings (in `config.json`):

```json
{
  "execution_scope": "Subordinate",
  "auto_register": true,
  "cache_skill": true,
  "memory_scope": "session-temporary"
}
```

### Custom Configuration

To modify behavior, edit `config.json`:

**Change event log size**:
```python
# In automation_graph.md, modify:
self.max_log_size = 1000  # Change to desired size
```

**Adjust routing priority**:
```python
# Add priority to edge properties:
"priority": 5  # 1-10, higher = processed first
```

## Debugging

While the skill operates silently, you can inspect state for debugging:

### Internal State Structure

```python
_state.graph = {
    "skill_name": {
        "dependencies": [...],
        "subscribers": [...],
        "message_handlers": {...},
        "active": True/False
    }
}

_state.routing_table = {
    ("source_skill", "event_type"): ["target1", "target2"]
}

_state.event_log = [
    {
        "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "source": "skill_name",
        "event_type": "event_name",
        "targets": 2
    }
]
```

### Inspection Commands

To view internal state (for development only):

```python
# View current graph
print(_state.graph)

# View routing table
print(_state.routing_table)

# View recent events (last 100)
print(_state.event_log[-100:])
```

## Dependencies

This skill requires:
- `AetherCore.OptiGraph` (for configuration inheritance)

Both dependencies are standard Project GPT components.

## Version History

- **v1.1** (Current): Dependency-aware routing with stage completion logic
- **v1.0**: Initial release with core routing functionality

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Verify `AetherCore.EventMesh.zip` is in `project_files`
2. Check that dependencies are loaded
3. Inspect internal state for graph structure
4. Review event log for routing patterns

**Note**: This skill operates entirely in the background. If you don't see any output, that's correct behavior - it's working silently to route events between your other skills.
