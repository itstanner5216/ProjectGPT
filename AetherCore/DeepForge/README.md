# Aethercore.DeepForge v5.9

## Overview

The Deep Research Extension is a sophisticated analytical module designed to produce comprehensive, professionally-structured research reports with exceptional data fidelity and verification standards. This skill operates as a subordinate extension to the Full-Output Intelligence Protocol, providing advanced research capabilities through a six-phase execution pipeline.

## Core Capabilities

### Multi-Phase Research Pipeline
- **Step 0**: Adaptive query clarification with confidence modeling
- **Step 1**: Query decomposition into focused sub-research questions
- **Step 2**: Critical data harvesting with diversity quotas
- **Step 3**: Triple-source verification with mechanistic explanations
- **Step 4**: Structural template enforcement and narrative synthesis
- **Step 5**: Professional tone refinement and citation validation
- **Step 5.5**: Self-critique and iterative refinement

### Key Features
- **Triple-Source Verification**: Every fact cross-checked against multiple independent sources
- **Confidence Tiering**: High/Medium/Low confidence assignments based on source independence
- **Mechanistic Reasoning**: Explicit explanations of HOW techniques and methods function
- **Conflict Resolution**: Side-by-side presentation of contradictory information with independence tags
- **Narrative Synthesis**: Continuous prose output with forbidden bullet usage for professional reports
- **Fidelity Preservation**: High-fidelity quantitative data protected from editorial changes

## Integration Instructions

### Installation
1. Place the `AetherCore.DeepForge3.zip` file in your Project-GPT project files directory
2. The Universal Skill Integration Framework will automatically detect and register the skill
3. Verify registration by checking for the activation confirmation message

### Dependencies
This skill requires:
- Full-Output Intelligence Protocol (parent framework)
- Universal Skill Integration Framework v1.0 or higher
- Web search capabilities for data harvesting
- Document analysis tools for source verification

## Activation Commands

The skill responds to multiple activation phrases including:
- "Activate deep research on [topic]"
- "Run deep research mode for [query]"
- "Enable deep research protocol"
- "Launch comprehensive research analysis"
- "Initiate research protocol on [subject]"
- "Use deep research to investigate [question]"

## Example Usage

### Basic Research Request
```
User: Activate deep research on modern CPU power optimization techniques
System: [Initiates Steps 0-5.5, produces 1200-2500 word analytical report]
```

### Research with Specific Constraints
```
User: Run deep research mode on lithium battery thermal management, focusing on automotive applications from 2020-2025
System: [Applies temporal and domain constraints, executes full protocol]
```

### Comparative Analysis
```
User: Enable deep research protocol to compare ARM vs x86 architecture efficiency
System: [Deploys comparison-style query decomposition, produces differential analysis]
```

## Output Specifications

### Report Structure
- **Introduction**: Clear restatement of scope and intent
- **Thematic Sections**: Hardware, Firmware/Software, Manufacturing, Synthesis
- **Verification Summary**: Distribution of High/Medium/Low confidence findings
- **Ranked Conclusion**: Top 3+ technologies/methods by measured impact
- **Sources Section**: Parenthetical citations throughout, closing bibliography

### Quality Guarantees
- Minimum 7 parenthetical citations
- 5+ unique domain sources
- 3+ different source types (official, expert, independent)
- 1200-2500 word count range
- Professional third-person scholarly voice
- Zero marketing tone or excessive adjectives

## Protocol States

The skill operates in two primary states:
1. **AWAITING_RESEARCH**: Default idle state, ready for activation
2. **ACTIVE_RESEARCH**: Executing Steps 0-5.5 for current query

## Performance Characteristics

### Evidence Standards
- High confidence: ≥3 independent source verification
- Medium confidence: 2 partially independent sources
- Low confidence: Single source or unverifiable

### Source Diversity Requirements
- Maximum 40% content from single domain
- Authority weighting: Official > Expert > Independent > User
- Recency bias: Prefer sources ≤12 months unless specified

### Conflict Handling
- Side-by-side presentation of contradictions
- Independence tagging for all conflicting claims
- Disagreement index calculation and reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Skill Not Activating**
- Verify the skill is properly registered in the project files
- Check that activation phrase matches recognized patterns
- Ensure Protocol_State is AWAITING_RESEARCH

**Incomplete Reports**
- Verify all data harvesting tools are accessible
- Check for connectivity issues preventing web searches
- Ensure minimum source requirements can be met

**Citation Errors**
- Confirm parenthetical format (Author, Year) is maintained
- Verify minimum citation count (7) is achieved
- Check that all quantitative claims have citations

## Technical Architecture

### Confidence Model
The skill employs a sophisticated confidence scoring system with nine weighted features:
- Explicit keywords (0.18)
- Temporal bounds (0.14)
- Domain specificity (0.14)
- Source constraints (0.12)
- Structure signals (0.12)
- Implicit cues (0.10)
- Context cache alignment (0.12)
- Ambiguity markers (-0.12)
- Conflict markers (-0.20)

### Composition Model
Enforces professional analytical writing through:
- Narrative continuous output style
- Forbidden bullet usage
- High paragraph density
- Mandatory transitional coherence
- Third-person scholarly voice

## Version History

### v5.9 (Current)
- Fidelity-Weighted Protocol implementation
- Enhanced mechanistic explanation requirements
- Improved conflict resolution matrix
- Quantitative data preservation rules
