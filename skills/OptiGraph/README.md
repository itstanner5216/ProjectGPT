# 🧩 AetherCore.OptiGraph — Project GPT Integration Readme

## Overview
**AetherCore.OptiGraph** is a modular Project GPT extension that dynamically adjusts reasoning behavior, verbosity, and resource allocation based on task context.  
It acts as a “meta-tuner,” optimizing model output fidelity, token usage, and execution efficiency without altering core logic or tone inheritance.

Once uploaded into Project GPT, the skill auto-registers via the **Universal Skill Integration Framework (USIF)** and runs in **subordinate mode** under the Full-Output Intelligence Protocol (FOIP).

---

## Capabilities
- **Adaptive Output Scaling** – Balances precision vs. throughput depending on the detected task type.  
- **Dynamic Reasoning Depth** – Expands or compresses internal reasoning paths as workload intensity changes.  
- **Execution Profiler** – Benchmarks task response time and token footprint to suggest future optimization targets.  
- **Memory Tuning** – Manages in-session cache for large analysis chains and deactivates idle modules.  
- **Compatibility Inheritance** – Works seamlessly alongside AetherCore.DeepForge, AetherCore.PromptFoundry, and AetherCore.MarketSweep modules.

---

## Integration Instructions
1. Upload `AetherCore.OptiGraph.zip` directly into your Project GPT workspace or chat.  
2. The USIF will:
   - Detect the `.zip` file,  
   - Read `config.json`,
   - Register `optimization_profile.md` as the primary controller.
3. Confirmation message:  
   ```
   [✓] Registered skill: AetherCore.OptiGraph
   Execution scope: Subordinate (tone inheritance enabled)
   ```
4. The skill remains active until session end or manual unload.

## Activation Examples
Use any natural activation phrase:
```
activate optimization profile
enable optimization tuning
run performance optimizer
launch AetherCore.OptiGraph
```

---

## Dependencies
- **Controller**: `optimization_profile.md` (core logic)
- **Config**: `config.json` (registration metadata)
- **Framework**: Requires Project GPT v1.0+ with FOIP & USIF enabled

## Technical Summary

| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| **Skill Name** | AetherCore.OptiGraph |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Execution Scope** | Subordinate |
| **Tone Inheritance** | True |
| **Auto-Registration** | Enabled |
| **Framework Compatibility** | Universal Skill Integration Framework ≥ 1.0 |
| **Memory Scope** | Session-temporary |
| **Cache Skill** | True |
| **Unload on Exit** | True |

---

## Behavior and Scope
When invoked, AetherCore.OptiGraph observes the current skill registry and adjusts system-level performance parameters.  
It does **not** override content logic — it refines *how* each skill executes.

Example:  
If AetherCore.PromptFoundry is generating a 6 k-token specification, AetherCore.OptiGraph may throttle intermediate verbosity and compress non-critical commentary before final output assembly.
